#arithmetic Operators

a =7
b = 8
c = a+b


# assignment operators
f = 6
f +=3 # it add 3 to previous value of f and store the new value
print(f)

k = 8

k -=2 # it reduce 3 to previous value of k and store the new value
print(k)

n = 6

n *=3
print(n)

#comparison operators
i = 5<4
print(i)

g = 5>4
print(g)

h = 6>=6
print(i)


#logical operators

e = True or False
print(e) #true , bcz its or operation, any value true , output true

v = True and False

print(v) #false, bcz its and operation , when all value true, output will be true
